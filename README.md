# Speak 2gether

In a group meeting, you ever interrupt someone because you thought they were finished speaking? Or they interrupted you? The solution is a visual cue that is easy to change with keyboard shortcuts. Teams/zooms way of having to click everytime is cumbersome. And the visual cue is small. Mines is a big red circle indicating it's not your team to speak. Or a big green circle indicating it is. You can download it on windows/mac and pin it in top of other windows.
